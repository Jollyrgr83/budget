## **Description**

A simple, fast, and easy-to-use budget app that uses a MongoDB database to track a user's credit and debit transactions from a bank account. Additionally, this app uses IndexedDB to ensure full functionality regardless of network connection.

## **User Story**

As a busy software developer who wants to track expenses, I have a need for an easy-to-use application to track my transactions and current account balance.

## **Usage**

* Add a title and a dollar amount in the applicable input fields and click the applicable add or subtract funds button to add a transaction. This app will upload all transactions to indexedDB if the connection to the server is lost and update the server with all saved transactions upon reconnection with the server.
